# How does disturbance effect insect communities on Sporobolus grasses? 

Testing the 'specialisation-disturbance hypothesis (SDH)' (Vasquez and Simberloff, 2003), which predicts that specialist herbivores will be effected more by disturbance than generalist species. 

I used the data collected from my Ph.D. on the endophagous insect communities associated with the two African grasses, Sporobolus pyramidalis and Sporobolus natalensis, to test the SDH. These data were not published in my Ph.D.
